# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0 alpha]

### Changed
- Overhauled the "Lens Thickness Calculator" with a more robust calculation for sphero-cylindrical lenses.
- Updated the "Lens Thickness Calculator" UI to use sliders for cylinder and axis for a more consistent user experience.

### Added
- Implemented a new 2D/3D visualization diagram for the "Lens Thickness Calculator" to show the lens profile and where minimum/maximum thickness occurs.

## [0.9 alpha]

### Added
- Implemented an experimental, AI-based "Problem Solver" to provide analysis and solutions for complex optical scenarios. (Note: Might be deleted depending on feedback).

### Changed
- The AI Problem Solver is hidden behind a feature flag for testing and can be enabled by adding `?enabled=true` to the URL.

## [0.8 alpha]

### Changed
- Improved navigation by adding a "Back" label to the return button on calculator pages.
- Refactored the footer component to prevent potential hydration errors and improve stability.

### Added
- Display the application version in the homepage footer.

## [0.5.1 alpha]

### Changed
- Reverted experimental UI changes and solidified calculator updates.

## [0.5 alpha]

### Changed
- Updated the "Lens Thickness Calculator" default minimum thickness to 2.0mm for more realistic results.
- Corrected the "Blank Size Calculator" formula and updated its input fields for better accuracy.

## [0.4 alpha]

### Changed
- Updated the application's background to a subtle and thematic design featuring various optical formulas.
- Renamed `CHANGELOG.md` to `CHANGELOG.txt` for easier file access.

## [0.3 alpha]

### Added
