# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.3 alpha]
### Changed
- Configured the Next.js project to generate a static export (`output: 'export'`) in preparation for being wrapped into a native mobile application.

## [2.2 alpha]
### Added
- Added a new "Contact Lens Rx Converter" to the Clinical Tools section to compensate spectacle prescriptions for vertex distance.

### Changed
- Standardized user input for prescriptions across multiple calculators. Sphere, Cylinder, and Axis fields now consistently use sliders with a default value of 0, creating a more uniform user experience.
- Improved the layout of the "Lens Thickness Calculator" by placing the cylinder and axis controls on the same line for a cleaner look.
- Enhanced input validation on several calculators to prevent errors and improve stability.

### Fixed
- Corrected the calculation formula and rounding logic in the "Contact Lens Rx Converter" to ensure it provides clinically accurate results in 0.25D steps.

## [2.1 alpha]
### Added
- Implemented the initial framework for a new "AI Image Analyzer" tool in the Clinical section to provide visual feedback. (Note: This feature is currently in testing and disabled on the UI).

## [2.0 alpha]
### Changed
- Alphabetized the items on the "Dispensing Tools" page for better organization.
- Added distinct, thematic background images to the main, clinical, and dispensing pages to improve visual identity.

### Added
- Implemented the initial framework for a new "AI Image Analyzer" tool in the Clinical section. This experimental feature allows users to upload an ocular image for an AI-powered analysis.

## [1.9.1]
### Fixed
- Resolved a persistent build error on the "Lens Thickness Calculator" page by refactoring the component structure.
- Corrected "duplicate key" errors in dropdown menus on the "Lens Thickness" and "Step-Along Vergence" calculators to improve UI stability.

### Changed
- Alphabetized drugs within each category in the Ocular Drugs Guide for easier reference.

## [1.9 alpha]

### Changed
- Overhauled the application's UI with a more professional and "cozy" theme, replacing the blue color scheme with a rich green and implementing a modern "frosted glass" effect on cards.
- The "Back" button on tool pages now correctly navigates to the user's previous page instead of always returning to the homepage, improving user experience.

### Fixed
- Resolved multiple critical bugs causing "duplicate key" errors in dropdown menus on the "Lens Thickness" and "Step-Along Vergence" calculators, ensuring UI stability.
- Corrected a rendering error on the "Lens Thickness" calculator page.
- Improved validation logic on the "Blank Size," "Induced Prism," and "BVD Conversion" calculators to prevent errors and ensure more reliable results.
- Removed a redundant "Vitreous" material from the "Step-Along Vergence" calculator to prevent confusion.

## [1.8 alpha]

### Added
- Created a new "Clinical Tools" section to group clinical guides and assistants.
- Moved the "Ocular Drugs Guide" and "AI Problem Solver" into the new "Clinical" section.
- Added "Step-Along Vergence" and "Prescription Transposer" to the "Dispensing Tools" page.

### Changed
- Reorganized the homepage to link to the new "Dispensing Tools" and "Clinical Tools" pages for a cleaner interface.

## [1.7 alpha]

### Added
- Created a new "Dispensing Tools" section to group related calculators like BVD, Lens Thickness, and Blank Size for better organization.
- Updated the homepage to reflect the new "Dispensing Tools" category.

## [1.6 alpha]

### Changed
- Reverted Next.js configuration to remove `output: 'export'` to allow for direct web publishing from Firebase Studio. This temporarily pauses native app preparation.
- Cleaned up unused code in the `blank-size` calculator page.

## [1.5 alpha]

### Added
- Added an easter egg where clicking the main title 10 times reveals a celebratory dialog.

## [1.4 alpha]

### Changed
- Configured the Next.js project to support static exports (`output: 'export'`) in preparation for integration with Capacitor to build for native mobile platforms.

## [1.3 alpha]

### Added
- Implemented a new "Ocular Pharmacology Guide" page to provide a quick reference for common UK drugs and their potential ocular side effects.
- Added categories to the drug guide, including "Prescription," "In-Practice," and "Over-the-Counter."
- Updated the drug guide to use nested accordions for better navigation.

## [1.2 alpha]

### Added
- Added high-quality SVG app icons and a web app manifest (`manifest.json`) to improve the look and behavior when the app is saved to a phone's home screen (PWA).

## [1.1 alpha]

### Changed
- Radically simplified the "AI Problem Solver" to use a single input field, removing the complex multi-part form to improve stability.
- The "AI Problem Solver" has been temporarily disabled and marked as "In Testing" on the homepage to prevent users from encountering bugs.
- Updated the "In Testing" banner to be more centrally located for better visibility.

### Fixed
- Resolved a persistent critical bug in the "AI Problem Solver" that caused the application to crash on submission.

## [1.0 alpha]

### Changed
- Overhauled the "Lens Thickness Calculator" with a more robust calculation for sphero-cylindrical lenses.
- Updated the "Lens Thickness Calculator" UI to use sliders for cylinder and axis for a more consistent user experience.

### Added
- Implemented a new 2D/3D visualization diagram for the "Lens Thickness Calculator" to show the lens profile and where minimum/maximum thickness occurs.

### Fixed
- Resolved a bug causing duplicate keys in refractive index selection menus on various calculators, ensuring UI stability.

## [0.9 alpha]

### Added
- Implemented an experimental, AI-based "Problem Solver" to provide analysis and solutions for complex optical scenarios. (Note: Might be deleted depending on feedback).

### Changed
- The AI Problem Solver is hidden behind a feature flag for testing and can be enabled by adding `?enabled=true` to the URL.

## [0.8 alpha]

### Changed
- Improved navigation by adding a "Back" label to the return button on calculator pages.
- Refactored the footer component to prevent potential hydration errors and improve stability.

## [0.7 alpha]

### Changed
