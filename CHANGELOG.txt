# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.8 alpha]

### Added
- Created a new "Clinical Tools" section to group clinical guides and assistants.
- Moved the "Ocular Drugs Guide" and "AI Problem Solver" into the new "Clinical" section.
- Added "Step-Along Vergence" and "Prescription Transposer" to the "Dispensing Tools" page.

### Changed
- Reorganized the homepage to link to the new "Dispensing Tools" and "Clinical Tools" pages for a cleaner interface.

## [1.7 alpha]

### Added
- Created a new "Dispensing Tools" section to group related calculators like BVD, Lens Thickness, and Blank Size for better organization.
- Updated the homepage to reflect the new "Dispensing Tools" category.

## [1.6 alpha]

### Changed
- Reverted Next.js configuration to remove `output: 'export'` to allow for direct web publishing from Firebase Studio. This temporarily pauses native app preparation.
- Cleaned up unused code in the `blank-size` calculator page.

## [1.5 alpha]

### Added
- Added an easter egg where clicking the main title 10 times reveals a celebratory dialog.

## [1.4 alpha]

### Changed
- Configured the Next.js project to support static exports (`output: 'export'`) in preparation for integration with Capacitor to build for native mobile platforms.

## [1.3 alpha]

### Added
- Implemented a new "Ocular Pharmacology Guide" page to provide a quick reference for common UK drugs and their potential ocular side effects.
- Added categories to the drug guide, including "Prescription," "In-Practice," and "Over-the-Counter."
- Updated the drug guide to use nested accordions for better navigation.

## [1.2 alpha]

### Added
- Added high-quality SVG app icons and a web app manifest (`manifest.json`) to improve the look and behavior when the app is saved to a phone's home screen (PWA).

## [1.1 alpha]

### Changed
- Radically simplified the "AI Problem Solver" to use a single input field, removing the complex multi-part form to improve stability.
- The "AI Problem Solver" has been temporarily disabled and marked as "In Testing" on the homepage to prevent users from encountering bugs.
- Updated the "In Testing" banner to be more centrally located for better visibility.

### Fixed
- Resolved a persistent critical bug in the "AI Problem Solver" that caused the application to crash on submission.

## [1.0 alpha]

### Changed
- Overhauled the "Lens Thickness Calculator" with a more robust calculation for sphero-cylindrical lenses.
- Updated the "Lens Thickness Calculator" UI to use sliders for cylinder and axis for a more consistent user experience.

### Added
- Implemented a new 2D/3D visualization diagram for the "Lens Thickness Calculator" to show the lens profile and where minimum/maximum thickness occurs.

### Fixed
- Resolved a bug causing duplicate keys in refractive index selection menus on various calculators, ensuring UI stability.

## [0.9 alpha]

### Added
- Implemented an experimental, AI-based "Problem Solver" to provide analysis and solutions for complex optical scenarios. (Note: Might be deleted depending on feedback).

### Changed
- The AI Problem Solver is hidden behind a feature flag for testing and can be enabled by adding `?enabled=true` to the URL.

## [0.8 alpha]

### Changed
- Improved navigation by adding a "Back" label to the return button on calculator pages.
- Refactored the footer component to prevent potential hydration errors and improve stability.

## [0.7 alpha]

### Changed
- Reordered the calculator cards on the homepage for better usability.
- Reverted experimental background design to ensure app stability.

## [0.6 alpha]

### Added
- Display the application version in the homepage footer.

## [0.5.1 alpha]

### Changed
- Reverted experimental UI changes and solidified calculator updates.

## [0.5 alpha]

### Changed
- Updated the "Lens Thickness Calculator" default minimum thickness to 2.0mm for more realistic results.
- Corrected the "Blank Size Calculator" formula and updated its input fields for better accuracy.

## [0.4 alpha]

### Changed
- Updated the application's background to a subtle and thematic design featuring various optical formulas.
- Renamed `CHANGELOG.md` to `CHANGELOG.txt` for easier file access.

## [0.3 alpha]

### Added
- Implemented the "Prescription Transposer" tool to convert eyeglass prescriptions between plus and minus cylinder formats.
- Added a new page and menu item on the homepage for the transposer.

## [02 alpha]

### Added
- Introduced the "Lens Thickness Calculator" for calculating edge and center thickness.
- Added a visualization diagram for the calculated lens thickness.
- Added a new menu item on the homepage for the thickness calculator.

### Changed
- Set the default refractive index to "Standard Index" across all relevant calculators for consistency.
