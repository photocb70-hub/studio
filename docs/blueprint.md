# **App Name**: Optical Prime

## Core Features:

- Lens Thickness Calculation: Calculates lens thickness based on prescription and lens parameters, dependent on frame parameters.
- Edge Thickness Calculation: Calculates the edge thickness of a lens based on user inputs, creating a diagram where the edge thickness lays.
- Induced Prism Calculation: Calculates induced prism based on lens decentration and power.
- Rx Tolerance Analysis: Analyzes whether a given lens prescription is within tolerance based on standard industry limits; advises whether refabrication is needed. This tool will use industry standards to determine acceptability.
- Main Menu: Presents a menu to navigate to Lens Thickness, Edge Thickness, Induced Prism, and Rx Tolerances sections.
- Results Display: Clearly displays calculated values and analysis results.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to evoke trust and precision.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) to ensure readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: Vibrant cyan (#00B8D4) for interactive elements and important results.
